The problem involves rescuing Princess Peach in a square grid from the center of the grid while navigating through empty cells. The grid is provided as input, and the goal is to find the shortest path to the cell containing 'p' (Princess Peach) from the cell containing 'm' (Mario) in the center of the grid. The solution I provided is a JavaScript function named displayPathtoPrincess that calculates the row and column differences between Mario and Princess Peach's positions and prints out the required moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) to reach Princess Peach. This solution guides Mario to rescue Princess Peach efficiently with the shortest path.
